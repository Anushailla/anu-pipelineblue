@@@@@@@->I have done POC on CICD Project DevOps (Git, Github, Jenkins, Maven, AWS:
*When the developer develops and tests the code in the local repository then push code into the remote repository through sonar code.
*The sonar code will review the code based on developer metrics if any duplicate files are there then it retrieves back to the local repository.
*After pushing the code to the remote repository. Integrate remote repository to Jenkins.
*Jenkins will convert raw code into structure code by creating jobs.
*Maven will convert structure code into Archive files (war. file, jar. file).
*Maven will deploy the code into the application cloud server.Â
